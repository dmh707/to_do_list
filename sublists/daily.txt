-AA CATEGORY
this is a category or tag.
categories are indicated by - at the beginning of the line.
I capitalize them for readability.
they show up alphabetically in your list.txt.
I usually load my daily list, stop the program, 
and then put letters or numbers next to my categories to give them an order
and then restart the program
if you use the exact same name of a category in multiple files, 
those categories will be combined automatically
