this is where your list of completed tasks will go
I don't have a use for this file as yet except to count how many things you've done today
one task per line
but it might be useful in the future, if I wanted to build some sort of data analytics for my habits
the last_checked file is not for your use. It is for the generate_list file
to check when I last loaded the program.
could I have used this file for that purpose?
yes
but I didn't. Because adding a new file for that was easier for me at the time.
